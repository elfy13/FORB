# The Forbidden Set

Welcome to the forbidden cube. A GOAT inspired yugioh cube.
This project includes a few things:
1. dark_translator.py - Creates the xml file used by dr4fter
2. yugioh_set.xml - Actual xml file used by dr4fter formatted to be complaint with cockatrice xml. 
3. cube_list_text_only.txt - A text file which includes the proper names of all the cards in the cube (including some doubles, that's intentional) that you can copy into the cube option of dr4fter. All card names have "yugiohset_" prepended to them to avoid name conflicts with magic cards. 

# Cube Contents
The cube itself contains 480 cards, including 72 syncho, xyz, and link monsters. There are 6 main draftable strategies in the cube. To support these archetypes 2 copies of 15 cards were chosen to represent the archetype.

## Archetypes
1. Monarchs, tribute summon matters
2. Chaos, light and dark banishing
3. Spell Counters
4. Warrior Equipment
5. Pacman, flip monster matters
6. Normal Monster Matters
